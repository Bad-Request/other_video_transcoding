This single document contains all of the notes created for each [release](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases).

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.8.0)

Saturday, February 13, 2021

* Modify `other-transcode` to:
    * No longer automatically deinterlace video with a frame rate of 29.97 FPS.
    * No longer change the frame rate of any video in MPEG-2 format which was automatically deinterlaced.
    * Only automatically deinterlace non-progressive video.
    * Apply any automatic or explicit deinterlacing to all frames of the video, not just the interlaced frames.
    * Force a constant frame rate for any video in MPEG-2 format at 29.97 FPS.
* Add a `--yadif-params` option to `other-transcode` to allow customization of the `yadif` filter used for deinterlacing.
* Remove the deprecated `--all-eac3` option of `other-transcode`.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.7.0)

Monday, January 4, 2021

* Modify `other-transcode` to lower default target bitrates in order to significantly reduce the size of transcoded output at the risk of a slight reduction in perceived quality. Via [ #89](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/89).

H.264 video:

Resolution | old | new
--- | --- | ---
1080p (Blu-ray video) | 8000 Kbps | 6000 Kbps
720p | 4000 Kbps | 3000 Kbps
480p (DVD video) | 2000 Kbps | 1500 Kbps

HEVC video:

Resolution | old | new
--- | --- | ---
1080p (Blu-ray video) | 6000 Kbps | 4000 Kbps
720p | 3000 Kbps | 2000 Kbps
480p (DVD video) | 1500 Kbps | 1000 Kbps

Dolby Digital Plus (Enhanced AC-3) audio:

Channels | old | new
--- | --- | ---
Surround | 640 Kbps | 384 Kbps
Stereo | 256 Kbps | 192 Kbps
Mono | 128 Kbps | 96 Kbps

Note: There are no changes to default target bitrates for Dolby Digital (AC-3) and AAC audio formats.

* Change the `--eac3` option in `other-transcode` to use Dolby Digital Plus format for _all_ transcoded audio instead of just surround output.
* Deprecate the `--all-eac3` option in `other-transcode` since the `--eac3` option now has the same behavior.
* Add a `--aac-stereo` option to `other-transcode`. This uses AAC format for transcoded stereo audio output so it can be paired with `--eac3` to get that option's old behavior.
* Add a `--8-bit-vc1` option. When the color depth is currently 10-bit, this option uses an 8-bit color depth _for video inputs in VC-1 format only_.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.6.0)

Tuesday, December 22, 2020

* Lower the default target bitrates for 8-bit HEVC video in `other-transcode` to match the defaults for 10-bit HEVC video. This means, for example, the default target for HEVC at a 1080p resolution will be 6000 Kbps no matter the output bit depth.
* Modify `other-transcode` to set the video buffer size equal to the maximum video bitrate when using an Nvidia encoder, essentially adding `--rc-bufsize 3` to the command line. Previously the buffer size was never explicitly set so `ffmpeg` would use a default value of twice the target bitrate. Since the maximum bitrate is normally three times the target bitrate this meant the buffer size was actually smaller than the maximum. While this didn't cause any known problems, Nvidia recommends a larger buffer size to improve quality. However, using `--rc-bufsize 0` will restore the old behavior and the default value from `ffmpeg`.
* Ignore the `--nvenc-lookahead` option in `other-transcode` when the argument is `0` since such a value won't change the behavior of an Nvidia encoder anyway.
* Add a `--limit-ac3-surround` option to `other-transcode` which prevents surround audio in AC-3 or Dolby Digital Plus (Enhanced AC-3) format from being copied instead of transcoded when the orginal bitrate is above the transcoding bitrate. This allows setting a lower target with the `--surround-bitrate` option in order to force higher-bitrate tracks to be transcoded instead of copied. 
* Reduce the minimum bitrates for Dolby Digital Plus audio in `other-transcode` from 256, 128 and 64 Kbps for surround, stereo and mono layouts to 192, 96 and 48 Kbps. The default bitrates for Dolby Digital Plus audio remain the same and this change does not affect audio output in AC-3 or AAC formats.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.5.0)

Tuesday, November 24, 2020

* Add `--qsv-decoder` and `--qsv-device` options to `other-transcode`, both of which enable the scoped use of the Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) decoder instead of the generic hardware decoder. These options can significantly speed operation of the QSV encoder, invoked via `--qsv`. It's recommended that `--decode all` be included when using these options to decode all video input formats. The `--qsv-device` option allows selection of specific hardware by number or path depending on platform. Please note that deinterlacing, cropping, scaling or using other filters will disable QSV's format-specific decoders.
* Remove all deprecated options and arguments from `other-transcode`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.4.0)

Sunday, November 1, 2020

* Modify the behavior and augment the capabilities of both encoding and decoding when using Nvidia hardware with `other-transcode`. This is necessary for compatibility with unleased versions of `ffmpeg` which are now built using the new Nvidia Software Development Kit (SDK) version 11.0. This SDK changes default encoder behavior and adds new presets which allow finer control of the performance/quality trade-off when transcoding video. To allow maximum performance, `other-transcode` no longer enables some quality settings by default:
    * Multipass mode, now accessible via a new `--nvenc-multipass` option. Be advised that any improved quality from enabling multipass mode is probably not worth the performance impact.
    * Spatial and temporal adaptive quantization (AQ), accessible via the `--nvenc-spatial-aq` and `--nvenc-temporal-aq` options. While enabling spatial AQ is still useful in reducing color banding for some inputs, be advised that enabling temporal AQ is probably not necessary and can cause some other side effects.
* Add support for seven new Nvidia encoder presets to `other-transcode`. Use `--preset p1` for best performance and `--preset p7` for best quality. It's not necessary to use `--preset p4` since that's the default. See the [Nvidia preset migration guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/video-technologies/video-codec-sdk/nvenc-preset-migration-guide/index.html) to understand how these presets work and how they map to older behavior.
* Add a `--nvenc-rc-mode` option to `other-transcode` for backward comaptibility with `ffmpeg` version 4.3.1 and older.
* Add `--cuda` and `--no-cuda` options to `other-transcode`. These options enable or disable the scoped use of the Nvidia CUDA hardware decoder instead of the generic hardware decoder. By default the CUDA _decoder_ is enabled when using the Nvidia video _encoder_, but disabled when using other encoders.
* Deprecate the `--cuvid` option in `other-transcode` because the CUDA decoder is faster and more flexible.
* Deprecate `--preset none` in `other-transcode` because it's no longer necessary.
* Always use hyphen-based spellings of Nvidia AQ options in `ffmpeg` commands generated by `other-transcode`.
* Add `--x264-params` and `--x265-params` options to `other-transcode` for _very_ advanced manipulation of the `x264` and `x265` software encoders.
* Modify `other-transcode` to assume a video input without a `field_order` tag is progressive instead of interlaced so a deinterlace fliter is not automatically and incorrectly applied to that video. This avoids problems with some 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray rips.
* Update the link to Docker containers for Linux in the "README" document. Thanks, @ttyS0!

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.3.2)

Friday, September 11, 2020

* Modify `other-transcode` to use a new `ffmpeg` Matroksa muxer option so the `-disposition` option is once again honored when using `ffmpeg` version 4.3 and later.
* Change the codec ID from the default of `hev1` to `hvc1` for HEVC video in MP4 output from `other-transcode` to enable playback in QuickTime on macOS. Via [ #50](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/50).
* Convert added SRT format subtitles to MOV-compatible format in MP4 output from `other-transcode`. Via [ #55](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/55).

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.3.1)

Tuesday, May 26, 2020

* Modify the `--preview-crop` option in `other-transcode` to show commands compatible with newer versions of `mpv`.
* No longer force a NTSC film frame rate for interlaced inputs in PAL MPEG-2 format.
* When using the `--dry-run` option in `other-transcode`, issue a warning instead of failing if the output or log files already exist.
* Add a link to another Docker container for Linux in the "README" document. Thanks, @ttyS0!

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.3.0)

Thursday, February 27, 2020

* Add a `--scan` option to `other-transcode`. This prints media information and then exits, allowing easy identification of track numbers and formats. Via [ #11](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/11).
* Add a `--mono-bitrate` option to `other-transcode`. This sets the mono audio bitrate, which is otherwise 50% of the stereo bitrate.
* Raise the maximum bitrates for audio in AAC format to 320 Kbps for stereo and 256 Kbps for mono. The default birates remain the same.
* Add a `--all-eac3` option to `other-transcode`. This uses the Dolby Digital Plus (Enhanced AC-3) format for all transcoded audio. The behavior of the `--eac3` option, which uses Dolby Digital Plus for surround audio only, remains the same.
* Add a `--keep-ac3-stereo` option to `other-transcode`. This copies stereo and mono audio in AC-3 format even when the original source bitrate is above the output transcoding bitrate.
* Add a `--pass-dts` option to `other-transcode`. This enables passthrough of audio in DTS and DTS-ES formats. However, such audio also in surround format will still be transcoded if that audio is output to a stereo-width track.
* Add `--rc-maxrate` and `--rc-bufsize` options to `other-transcode`. These set the ratecontrol maximum rate and/or the buffer size as a multiple of the video bitrate target, but only for certain encoders and ratecontrol systems.
* Add a `--x264-mbtree` option to `other-transcode`. This uses macroblock-tree ratecontrol and disables AVBR if in use.
* In order to ensure compatible H.264 levels, limit the number of reference frames when using the `x264` encoder with slower presets.
* Remove the deprecated `--name` option of `other-transcode`.
* Add a link to a Docker container for Linux in the "README" document. Thanks, @ttyS0!

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.2.0)

Monday, January 13, 2020

* Allow `all` to be used as an argument to the `--add-audio` and `--add-subtitle` options of `other-transcode`, adding all audio tracks or all subtitle tracks. Via [ #3](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/3).
* Add `original` as a width attribute to the `--main-audio` and `--add-audio` options of `other-transcode`. Unlike `stereo` and `surround`, this disables transcoding and always copies the selected track(s). Via [ #5](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/issues/5).
* Add a `--copy-video` option to `other-transcode`. This disables transcoding and copies the original video track to the output.
* No longer ignore any image-based subtitles added to MP4 output. Instead, let `ffmpeg` foolishly add DVD-style subtitles and (currently) fail when adding Blu-ray Disc-style subtitles.
* Deprecate the `--name` option of `other-transcode` because it doesn't make sense to name only the first output file from a tool which can take multiple inputs. The option still works for now, but using it issues a warning message. It will be removed in a future release.
* Remove warnings when other options disable the Nvidia video decoder, which could only happen if the `--burn-subtitle` or `--detelecine` options were used with the `--cuvid` option.

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.1.1)

Friday, January 3, 2020

* Prevent passing full or partial paths to the `--name` option of `other-transcode`.
* Hide the path prefix when naming the program in `--help` output and in usage errors for both `other-transcode` and `ask-ffmpeg-log`.
* In the "README" document:
    * Add warnings to avoid installing within virtual machines and about the possible need to use `sudo`.
    * Add a link to additional documentation on the wiki for installing `ffprobe`, `ffmpeg`, `mkvpropedit` and `mpv` on Windows.
    * Also explain how to install those same programs on macOS using Homebrew.
* Update all copyright notices to the year 2020.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/donmelton/other_video_transcoding/releases/tag/0.1.0)

Thursday, December 26, 2019

* Initial project version.
